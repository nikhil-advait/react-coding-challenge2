### About this example
 This example is to demostrate use of react, redux as flux architecture and webpack (mostly used for HMR).
 This example is actually an assignment/challenge. Please go in challege/ directory and read problem statement.
 
### Few notes
- Used React 0.13
- Used Redux as flux architecture. I could have done only with React but redux is nicer :) (wanted to use react-router as well but since there was only one page so didn't make much sense)
- Used ES6 (except class syntax..I don't like that much :) )
- Used Babel, webpack, react hot module replace (oh, development feels so great with hot reloading :) ) etc
- Comments can be collapsed also on toggle click

### Instructions to run app 
- Clone repo
- run command "$npm install" within folder. 
- run command "$npm start" to start server
- server will start on port 3001. 
- open localhost:3001 from browser
- Note that I was using node v0.12.7 (in case you face any issue while running).
